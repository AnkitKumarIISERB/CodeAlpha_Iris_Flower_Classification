# CodeAlpha_Iris_Flower_Classification
This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.   The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into one of three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** — based on their sepal and petal measurements.
